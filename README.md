Created a Digital FIR filter using C/C++ which involves 1-D
convolution of filter coefficients and input data. Used only plus,
minus and shift operations (do not use multiply).
Filter order N=255, Power-of-Two (POT) digit limit to 2-16
POT representation of filter coefficients are given
Leading inputs are zeros (e.g. x(-255)=x(-254)= ··· =x(-2)=x(-1)=0)
